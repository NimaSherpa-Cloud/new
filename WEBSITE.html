    <h1>!!Visit Nepal!!</h1>
    <p>For the Himalayan country Nepal and its tourism industry, spring is the season of Mt. Everest expedition. This year's spring is different as COVID-19 pandemic has brought the whole world to a standstill. Nepali Sherpa community regards Mt. Everest as God. Sherpas are dependent upon mountains for livelihood. But this time, they are compelled to be locked up inside their homes. However, their kindness and compassion have touched many lives even during this crisis. Despite losing jobs and the only income source, they are determined to support each other especially those less privileged.</p>
